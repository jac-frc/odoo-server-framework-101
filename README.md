# Jim's Odoo Practice
Herein lies the `estate` module, my unique verison of it, from completing the _Server Framework 101_ tutorial. 

Additionally, I found the [odoo/technical-training-solutions](https://github.com/odoo/technical-training-solutions) sometime after **Chapter 12** because I wanted to get on with actual development, and used some components from there.  I still typed it all in to this repository, you know, for proper learning purposes.

### `estate_account`
I am unable to test `estate_account` because the accounting module is unavailable on the community edition.
